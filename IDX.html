        <h3>Who you (the agent) are</h3>
        <p>
            I work for IDX, A ZeroFox Company, we are a data breach and recovery company. We 
            have been hired to help answer questions regarding this incident. We have been provided a 
            substantial amount of information and training to help answer questions. You can also look

        <h3>Why does Change Health care have my data </h3>
        <p>
            Change Healthcare provides services to health care providers, health plans, and health care companies. It appears you received services from a health care provider or were a member of a health plan that uses Change Healthcare’s services. It is also possible that you served as the parent, primary insured, or guarantor for an individual who received such services. 
            A guarantor is the person who paid the bill.If Change Healthcare was able to attribute a specific health care provider or health care plan to your data, then their name would likely be listed in your letter.  If we have not been able to assign a specific health care provider or health plan to your data, then you may have received a more general letter so you have information on how to sign up for credit monitoring and identity protection services if you wish to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>What data was involved for me</h3>
        <p>
            Given the volume and complexity of the data involved, Change Healthcare cannot confirm exactly what data has been affected for each impacted individual, but the information involved may have included contact information (such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, and email) plus one or more of the following: health insurance data, health data, billing, insurance claims and payment data, and other personal data (such as Social Security number, driver’s license or state ID number, or other ID number). 
            The data that may have been involved was not the same for every impacted individual. Change Healthcare continues to see no evidence that materials such as doctors’ charts or full medical histories were removed from its systems.
