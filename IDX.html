        <h3>Email address already in use</h3>
        <p>You have to send an email too productsupport@idx.us and in the email you will explain their email is in our system from a prior breach,and it is preventing you from enrolling in current breach.</p>

        <h3>Who you (the agent) are</h3>
        <p>
            I work for IDX, A ZeroFox Company, we are a data breach and recovery company. We 
            have been hired to help answer questions regarding this incident. We have been provided a 
            substantial amount of information and training to help answer questions. You can also look 
            us up online at www.idx.us
        </p>

        <h3>Why does Change Health care have my data </h3>
        <p>
            Change Healthcare provides services to health care providers, health plans, and health care companies. It appears you received services from a health care provider or were a member of a health plan that uses Change Healthcare’s services. It is also possible that you served as the parent, primary insured, or guarantor for an individual who received such services. 
            A guarantor is the person who paid the bill. If Change Healthcare was able to attribute a specific health care provider or health care plan to your data, then their name would likely be listed in your letter.  If we have not been able to assign a specific health care provider or health plan to your data, then you may have received a more general letter so you have information on how to sign up for credit monitoring and identity protection services if you wish to do so.
        </p>

        <h3>What data was involved for me</h3>
        <p>
            Given the volume and complexity of the data involved, Change Healthcare cannot confirm exactly what data has been affected for each impacted individual, but the information involved may have included contact information (such as name, address, date of birth, phone number, and email) plus one or more of the following: health insurance data, health data, billing, insurance claims and payment data, and other personal data (such as Social Security number, driver’s license or state ID number, or other ID number). 
            The data that may have been involved was not the same for every impacted individual. Change Healthcare continues to see no evidence that materials such as doctors’ charts or full medical histories were removed from its systems.
        </p>

        <h3>What information was breached</h3>
        <p>
            Based on initial targeted data sampling to date, the company has found files containing protected health information (PHI) which could cover a substantial proportion of people in America. This data may include PHI from transactional claims data such as health insurance member ID numbers, diagnostic and treatment codes, payments and balances and provider identities. The data may also include full names, dates of birth, addresses and social security numbers. To date, the company has not seen evidence of removal
            of materials like doctors’ charts or full medical histories among the data.
        </p>

        <h3>Enrollment without email address</h3>
        <p>
            I am able to assist with this but before we proceed, I want to advise you of the limitations and delays associated with this option.  If you enroll without an email address, you will not have access to your account online. You also will not have immediate access to alerts and must wait for a communication regarding any new alerts to be sent via postal mail, which can take from 5-7 business days to reach you. 
            The communication will not contain any specific information about the alert and will require you to call in during business hours for assistance. Taking all this into consideration, would you like to provide an email address for your membership?
